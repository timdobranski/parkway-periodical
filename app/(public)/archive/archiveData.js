      caption: `Parkway Middle School Construction, 1960s. The office building now at the center of the campus originally marked the front entrance of the school.
      Other buildings were added over the years, extending the entrance further outward until the office was in the center rather than the front of the school.

      The school didn't open until a month or so after the start of the school year, so during that time Parkway's first class of students attended classes at Northmont
      Elementary School in the afternoon once the elementary students had gone home.`

      caption: `A completion date of April 1961 is hoped for the Parkway Junior High School
      to be built on Dallas street, adjacent to Fletcher Parkway, in north La Mesa, Dr. Ted Dixon, asspciate superintendent of the
      La Mesa-Spring Valley School District, said today. Construction may be able to start in July, Dixon said, depending on final approval
      and apportionment of funds from the state before a contract can be awarded. Archetect for the project is Clyde Hufbauer.
      Originally the junior high school was not scheduled to be built until 1961 or 1962, Dixon said. Date of construction was moved
      up because of a tremendous influx of residents, necessitating speeded up planning.`

      caption: `This year Parkway Junior High School will have a modification in its organization which will result, it is hoped,
      in a more efficient use of pupil time and should bring about more instructional learning, according to Dr. David Pascoe, assistant
      superintendent-instruction of the La Mesa-Spring Valley School District. Dr Pascoe told the Board of Trustees Tuesday night that for years schools
      have stressed the need to introduce flexibility in class scheduling. Parkway Pupils will take a block of two periods in certain subjects every other day.
      Thus, time will be equalized over a two-week period, but this will permit a longer instructional time for courses, such as: industrial arts, homemaking,
      music, art, and physical education. In order to activate this program, it was necessary to review the District's plans with certain departments in
      Sacramento for approval.`,
