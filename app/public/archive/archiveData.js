      caption: `A completion date of April 1961 is hoped for the Parkway Junior High School
      to be built on Dallas street, adjacent to Fletcher Parkway, in north La Mesa, Dr. Ted Dixon, asspciate superintendent of the
      La Mesa-Spring Valley School District, said today. Construction may be able to start in July, Dixon said, depending on final approval
      and apportionment of funds from the state before a contract can be awarded. Archetect for the project is Clyde Hufbauer.
      Originally the junior high school was not scheduled to be built until 1961 or 1962, Dixon said. Date of construction was moved
      up because of a tremendous influx of residents, necessitating speeded up planning.`
